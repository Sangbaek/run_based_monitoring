# timeline monitoring

Some groovy scripts maintained by Sangbaek Lee (sangbaek@mit.edu) for CLAS12 timeline monitoring. Scripts are based on initial works of Andrey Kim.

These groovy scripts will read offline monitoring codes that was initiated by FX, and later developed by Yordanka Illieva, Andrey Kim, and Sangbaek Lee.

# How to run them

The run scripts in repo are pretty self-explanatory. Please ask Sangbaek or Andrey about running the scripts.
